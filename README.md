# The Effect of STEM & VT Affinity on College Success

## Context
How often are students are excited about their classes? Every time I hear my friends discussing
the classes they are taking next semester, they moan and groan, as if college is the bane
of their existence. Then, there are the exceptions - the ones who are passionate about 
what they are studying, oozing pure joy with every word they utter. Why is there such a huge
difference in emotions from person to person?

## Problem
We want to investigate which subjects are best associated with how excited students are
for our class, "Data Matter." Specifically, we want to see if our love for math, statistics,
computer science, data science, and Virginia Tech is associated with how excited we are for
this data science class. We chose these predictors because we believed these are most
closely related to content of the class.

## Analysis
We are given a class survey data set comprising of responses to over 50 questions. We clean 
the data set, retrieve the appropriate columns and check the assumptions before conducting
multiple linear regression. To do so, we use correlation plots, stepwise regression, and
studentized Breusch-Pagan test to check for multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, etc.
We finally run a multiple linear regression model to depict a relationship between
the subjects and their excitement for "Data Matter."
